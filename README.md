`_s`
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

I'm not actually the original version of `underscores`, though; that honor belongs to [Automattic](http://github.com/automattic)'s [_s](http://github.com/automattic/_s) project. I'm a slightly more opinionated version of `_s`, with plenty of cool tricks baked in to make theme development quick, easy, and maintainable.

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* ~~2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.~~
* ~~Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.~~ _A smart, node-powered, Normalize/Bourbon/Neat/Bittters-based Sass configuration._
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
